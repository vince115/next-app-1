JavaScript closures are a fundamental concept that every JavaScript developer should understand. A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope.

Here's an example of a closure:

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
    console.log('Outer Variable:', outerVariable);
    console.log('Inner Variable:', innerVariable);
  };
}

const newFunction = outerFunction('outside');
newFunction('inside');
